			<h5>History of Bangladesh University of Business and Technology(BUBT)</h5>
			<p>Welcome to Bangladesh University of Business and Technology(BUBT). 
			It is one of the eight Universities to receive the Green Signal from the government, 
			inspite of its being one of the very young Private Universities of Bangladesh, only 10 years old,
			established in 2003. It is modeled on North American Universities and it was duly approved by the University 
			Grants Commission of Bangladesh (UGC) and the Ministry of Education, Government of the Peoples' Republic of Bangladesh.
			It was founded by Dhaka Commerce College, Mipur-2, Dhaka-1216 and is managed by a Board of Trustees and a Syndicate in which the Principal of the College and the Chairman of the Governing Body of the College are the Ex-Officio members. Thus BUBT and Dhaka Commerce College are the two institutions working together in peace and harmony for imparting quality education. Within a short time of its establishment BUBT has succeeded in transforming itself into one of 
			the leading Private Universities of Bangladesh and has since been providing quality education and training.</p>
